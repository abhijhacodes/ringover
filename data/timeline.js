We are often on the side where we buy our favourite coloured shoes made by someone else but what if we designed it ? What if we could involve in the making of a shoe we want to buy ? This little thought sprouted to become what we are today, KICKSUP ;)",

    text: "Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think when they buy were our top priorities before we moved further in the building. After weeks of fruitful research, we stepped into the user's shoes and look at what we plan to do. It's a great joy for the users if they are involved in the making. We're heading into an era of technology and people prefer online shopping to shopping in an outlet.",

This experience was crucial to our brand as this our first practical experience. Interacting with the users was the best thing ever. The positive reviews and support from the people motivated us to push our limits further.",
